# Mutlimedia Programming - Audio Algorithms
This is the Multimedia Programming project which implements the Audio Algorithms such as changing frequency, data encoding format (PCM) , amplitude, mono or stereo etc.

**Question 1:**

Write a software in Java that performs following.
1. Generate, play and save (in .wav file) a sinusoidal wave with following user
selectable parameters at run-time.
- a. Frequency (upto 20KHz)
- b. Data encoding format (PCM)
- c. Duration of the signal.
- d. Amplitude
- e. Mono or Stereo

2. Capture sound from an input device(i.e. microphone) and save (in .wav file).
Create a separate thread for user interface(UI). At any time, the user should be able to
enter any of the following minimum requirement.
- a) Stop playing a sound (if playing or capturing)
- b) Increase/Decrease volume (if playing).
- c) Increase/Decrease speed (e.g. fast forward, slow forward)
- d) The UI must be responsive all the time (weather a file is playing or not)
